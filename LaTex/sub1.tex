\section{Regression}
For the first half of this assignemnt we will try an use regression to predict the "refractive index - RI" of the glass given the chemical components contained in our dataset.\\
We will start of by just doing forward feature selection using k-fold cross-validation, such that we get the best variables for our linear regression, and reduce the chance of our model overfitting.\\
