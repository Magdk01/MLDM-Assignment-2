\section{Classification}
In this section, we will solve a classification problem using the \textit{Glass Identification} dataset. Specifically, we aim to classify the nominal attribute \texttt{Type of glass} based on the remaining attributes of the data. This attribute can assume seven distinct values as discussed in \textit{Project 1}, and as such, this is a multi-class classification problem.
